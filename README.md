# Bank-Note-Authentication
### This is a Project under Progress...................

End to End deployment for the Machine Learning model used for Bank Note Authentication

Development of Machine Learning model is based on the following description: 
Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.


Life Cycle of the project:
  1. Exploratory Data Analysis
  2. Feature Engineering
  3. Model Creation
  4. Creating a Web API using Flask and Flasgger
  5. Containerizing using Docker
  6. Deployment of the model on cloud


Status of Project: Completed upto the creating of Web API
